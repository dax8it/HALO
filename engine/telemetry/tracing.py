"""Catalyst-only AGENT-span wrapper.

Only meaningful for the Catalyst telemetry backend (``_setup_catalyst``
in ``engine.telemetry.setup``). The local JSONL backend doesn't need
these wrappers — it captures whatever spans the openai-agents SDK and
OpenAI instrumentation produce, with no extra grouping.

Why Catalyst needs it: catalyst-tracing's OpenAI instrumentation attaches
each ``OpenAI Responses`` span to whatever OTel span is active in
context. Without an outer AGENT span, every per-call span ends up at
the root of the trace and Catalyst dashboards show a flat list instead
of an agent tree. Wrapping the root run and each subagent invocation
in ``halo_agent_span`` is what gives Catalyst one trace per HALO run
with a proper hierarchy.

When telemetry is off or the local backend is in use, no global
``TracerProvider`` is registered and ``opentelemetry.trace.get_tracer``
returns the no-op proxy tracer. ``agent_span`` then yields a handle
backed by a ``NonRecordingSpan`` whose attribute setters are no-ops,
so callers don't need to special-case the off path.
